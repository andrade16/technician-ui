# Technician Dashboard UI
A simple dashboard interface to keep track of technician positions on a solar farm. 

## Set Up Instructions and Commands

In your terminal, navigate to the technician-ui directory, and from the root folder run:

- `npm install` - Installs all project dependencies. 

- `npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
the page will reload if you make edits and show errors in the console if there are any.


## Technologies Used 
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was used to get started on development right away
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) was used as the main component library 
- For styling, I decided to use SCSS, mainly because of variable usage and nested styling class declarations. One simple advantage to that is being able to establish your styles in the same hierarchy as the components are in your component files.
- For the map, I used [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js)


## Notes
- Most of the functionality is there, with the exception of some specific Notification technicalities. I'm happy to discuss the issues I came across when trying to properly implement Notifications, and some workarounds I thought about. 
With more time I would try to thoroughly address these issues.
